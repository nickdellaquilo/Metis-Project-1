The above is a chart generated from New York City Covid-19 data that is publically available [here](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/). Python was used to download the data, SQLAlchemy was used to filter it, and Matplotlib was used to generate the chart. This shows a downward trend in the 7-day average of cases during the week that we wish to compare MTA service usage to.
